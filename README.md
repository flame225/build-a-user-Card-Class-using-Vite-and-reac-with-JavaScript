# build-a-user-Card-Class-using-Vite-and-reac-with-JavaScript

1. Initialize a Vite app or use Create React App
2. Remove all unnecessary code
3. Import the CSS/JSON files into your App.jsx
4. Create a `UserCard` function component that takes in `name`, `phoneNumber`, `age`, and `address` props and has the same HTML as the `user.html` file.
5. Pass the user information into the `UserCard` component from the `App.jsx` file
6. Try manually changing the data in the `user.json` file to test that everything is hooked up properly
7. Repeat steps 4-6 but with a class component instead of a function component
